Generic (ish) Language Parser - "glop"
--------------------------------------

Valid Languages
===============
The Grammar implemented by this system is informally as follows:

program -> block
block -> BLOCKSTART statement_list BLOCKEND
statement_list -> statement*
statement -> (expression | expression ASSIGNMENT expression | ) EOL
expression -> oldexpression (COMMA expression)*
oldexpression -> (factor [factorlist] |  factor INFIXOPERATOR expression )
factorlist -> factor* factor 
factor -> ( bracketedexpression | constructorexpression | NUMBER | STRING | ID
          | factor DOT dotexpression | factor trailer | factor trailertoo )
dotexpression -> (ID bracketedexpression | factor )
bracketedexpression -> BRA [ expression ] KET
constructorexpression -> BRA3 [ expression ] KET3
trailer -> BRA2 expression KET2
trailertoo -> COLON EOL block

Whilst allowing some commonly known constructs - such as foo.bar(), this
also allows some more rather unusual ones like 2.("hello"."world") or even
2.(if self:
   print "Hello"
else:
   print "Rhubarb"
end)

A rather unusual decision was taken regarding operators - evaluation is left
to right rather than based on precedence. The only language I'm aware of
that also does this is Amiga E.

Currently also, the grammar does NOT support continuation over multiple
lines for expressions beyond block statement exprssions. This will probably
change at some point.

progs/
======
The files in this directory are all tests of valid syntax. They were used,
in the order they were numbered to drive the development of a PLY parser
for this language.

This approach has been significantly simpler than attempting to construct
the grammar the old fashioned way of design something that looks nice and
work back. Furthermore, it's also worked out to be significantly cleaner 
and more flexible. Some of the later files in the directory are samples of
code that are deliberate light touch translations of other languages into
this syntax to show that the approach is basically valid and that the parser
is capable of handling very different languages, whilst sharing a basic
common grammar.

expr_29.p - This is designed as a realistic test and is a direct
translation of the actual main parser code. The fact this works quite well
tends to suggest that the parser is realistic in terms of constructs it can
handle and represent.

expr_33.p - This is an example that assumes a LOGO like language using the
parser. I haven't looked at LOGO since I was a child so this example is
skewed by the little I remember of it, but it should show a fairly different
looking language.

expr_34.p - This is a simple example of defining a custom little language for
representation of domain specific data. In this case the language is
designed for defining stochastic L-Systems for modeling generic biological
systems.

expr_35.p - This is a simple example of a stack implementation in a simple SML-like
language. Specifically, note that the language allows ids to be prefixed and
suffixed using ' characters as is common in such languages.

expr_37.p - This is an example of a light touch modification of an ancient
Amiga E syntax module that implements a simple "person" object. The
differences from the original code are highly minimal, and the resulting
code has a very similar look and feel to the original.

Note also - we do NOT require keywords - the reason for this is the strict 
whitespace/indentation that is enforced allows us to detect the block
structure, and hence we don't need keywords. However, note that as a result
that many block structures will require a terminator keyword.

Currently the abstract syntax tree returned is rather OTT, and needs
simplifying before use in anger, but it is expected that most languages
implemented using this parser will undertake some form of tree
transformation anyway.

This parser uses a trivially modified version of the PLY parser toolkit,
which is included in this directory. (It's a one line patch around line 2184
in yacc.py)
